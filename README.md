# Winter in Data Science: Into the Realm of RL

Welcome to the **Winter in Data Science** 2024 program hosted by IIT Bombay! This repository contains all resources, assignments, and projects for the _Into the Realm of Reinforcement Learning_ module. This program will guide you through foundational concepts and problem-solving techniques in Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on real-world applications and hands-on coding assignments.

## Program Overview

This 5-week program is designed to introduce and develop understanding of RL concepts, using a structured, project-based approach. Each week, we will cover new topics, and by the end, you will have completed a capstone project based on game-solving using RL principles.

## Course Outline
- **Week 1**: Catching up on numpy library, Multi Armed Bandit problem (Epsilon Greedy Method)
- **Week 2**: MAB problem (Upper Confidence Bound approach) and MDP (Introduction)
- **Week 3**: Dynamic Programming+(Jack's Car Rentals and Gambler's Problem)
- **Week 4**: Dynamic Programming continued, Final project declared (based on solving games using RL)
- **Week 5**: Final projectÂ continued

## Weekly Plan

> **Note:** The weekly plan will be updated every week. Please keep an eye on it!
