# Winter in Data Science: Into the Realm of RL

Welcome to the **Winter in Data Science** 2024 program hosted by IIT Bombay! This repository contains all resources, assignments, and projects for the _Into the Realm of Reinforcement Learning_ module. This program will guide you through foundational concepts and problem-solving techniques in Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on real-world applications and hands-on coding assignments.

## Program Overview

This 5-week program is designed to introduce and develop understanding of RL concepts, using a structured, project-based approach. Each week, we will cover new topics, and by the end, you will have completed a capstone project based on game-solving using RL principles.

## Course Outline
- **Week 1**: Catching up on numpy library, Multi Armed Bandit problem (Epsilon Greedy Method)
- **Week 2**: MAB problem (Upper Confidence Bound approach) and MDP (Introduction)
- **Week 3**: Dynamic Programming+(Jack's Car Rentals and Gambler's Problem)
- **Week 4**: Dynamic Programming continued, Final project declared (based on solving games using RL)
- **Week 5**: Final projectÂ continued

# Week 0: Basics of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Numpy

Resources picked from this [repo](https://github.com/deeksha-4/WiDS-23-Into_the_Realm_of_Neural_Networks/blob/36e94bf31c9cac60b03ef4fbc7d0100826f079d6/Week1/README.md)

## Python

Let's kick off this project by covering the basics of Python. It's completely fine if you're new to the language; it's one of the easiest to learn and won't take long to pick up.
Here are some tutorials to get you started:

- [**YouTube Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
- [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) for reference

You don't need to cover the entire content of the video above, make sure to focus mainly on data types and the syntax for conditional statements, loops, functions  and basic file handling.

## NumPy
NumPy, or Numerical Python, is a Python library widely used to operate on vectors and matrices (called *arrays*). It is arguably the most important Python library when it comes to developing neural networks and in data science in general. A major reason for NumPy's popularity is its use of *vectorization*, which greatly speeds up computations involving arrays, as compared to traditional Python lists.

Here are some tutorials on NumPy:

- [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (**recommended**)
- [**Official NumPy Documentation**](https://numpy.org/) for further reference as and when required

Once you're done with the theory, we recommend that you attempt [**this optional assignment**](./Week1_NumPy_Assignment.ipynb) to practise using some popular NumPy functions. Make sure to download the Jupyter notebook from the repo before making changes to it.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Instead of building traditional Python scripts, in this project we will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** to write and run your code.

Jupyter notebooks allow you to divide your code into multiple cells that you can run individually one-by-one, allowing you to debug your code much more easily. You can go over the first few sections of [**this introductory document**](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) for installation and basic functionalities or [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) (only until Notebook creation and code execution)

## Weekly Plan

> **Note:** The weekly plan will be updated every week. Please keep an eye on it!
