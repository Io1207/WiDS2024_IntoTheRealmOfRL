# Week 4: Revisiting Dynamic Programming and Preparing for the Final Project

Welcome to Week 4 of the Reinforcement Learning program! This week is dedicated to consolidating your understanding of **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, catching up on any pending tasks, and gearing up for the final project.

## Learning Plan

### 1. Dynamic Programming Revisited
- **Objective**: Reinforce your understanding of dynamic programming techniques and complete any unfinished work.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Policy Evaluation and Improvement
  - Policy Iteration and Value Iteration
- **Recommended Resources** (same as previous week):
  - **Chapter 4** of *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Sutton & Barto (`SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf`)
  - **Lecture 3** from David Silver’s RL Slides (`lec3.pdf`)
- **Suggested Activities**:
  - Review your solutions for **Gambler’s Problem** and **Jack’s Car Rental Problem**.
  - Address any challenges or gaps in understanding from previous weeks.
  - Experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the solutions.

### 2. Final Project Announcement
- The final project will be announced this week. It will involve applying the concepts learned so far to solve a game using reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Stay tuned for details!**
